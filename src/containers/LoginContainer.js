    create a new class LoginContainer which returns the Login view,
    move all functionality to this class, refactor Login to return only jsx and take in props when needed.
    using connect function from react-redux library connect the LoginContainer class to the Redux store,
    use mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps functions, connecting the state and action to the component,
    import the container in the main index.js instead of Login component
